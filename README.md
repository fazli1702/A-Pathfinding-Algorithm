# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

This is a simple path finding algorithm visualiser using the A* path finding algorithm. This program is coded in python and uses the pygame library as the GUI.

## Customisation
You can change the values for the window size, the number of rows, cols etc. This values can be found in `constant.py`. However, you must ensure that the values `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` are divisible by `SQUARE_SIZE`
